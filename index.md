# Kaggle G2Net Challenge Attempt
## Joshua O'Cain

### Summary

In this page, I will cover my approaches to tackling the Kaggle G2Net Gravatitational Wave challenge. The challenge provided a data set generated
by the G2Net Collaboration simulating LIGO data from the LIGO Haverford, LIGO Livingston, and VIRGO detectors with and without a detected gravitational
wave. To tackle this time series classification problem, I employ a few different signal analysis and machine learning techniques, including FFTs,
Poincare plots, Wavelet Transforms, and Convolutional Neural Networks.
